Flower Recognition using Deep Learning
Project Overview
This project leverages the 'Flower Recognition' dataset from Kaggle to train a machine learning model capable of predicting flower images. The primary goal is to develop an accurate classification model for various flower species.

Features
Flower Image Classification: Identifies and classifies different types of flowers from input images.

Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a trained deep learning model for high accuracy.

Kaggle Dataset Integration: Built upon a well-known and comprehensive dataset for flower recognition.

Dataset
The model was trained using the 'Flower Recognition' dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle. This dataset contains a diverse collection of flower images, essential for robust model training.

Model Training
A deep learning model was trained on the aforementioned Kaggle dataset. The training process involved optimizing the model to accurately recognize patterns and features within flower images, enabling it to classify new, unseen images effectively.

Deployment
For the successful deployment and inference of this machine learning model, specific hardware will be required. This is due to the computational demands of running a deep learning model, especially for real-time predictions or processing large volumes of images.

Hardware Requirements
While exact specifications depend on the scale of deployment, typical requirements may include:

GPU (Graphics Processing Unit): Highly recommended for accelerated inference, especially for deep learning models.

Sufficient RAM: To handle image data loading and model operations.

Adequate Processor (CPU): For overall system operations.

Installation and Setup
(This section will be updated once the project code and dependencies are available.)

To set up this project locally, you would typically:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Bigyajeet/flower_recognization-using-Deeplearning-model.git
cd flower_recognization-using-Deeplearning-model

Install the required Python packages (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, scikit-learn).

Download the 'Flower Recognition' dataset from Kaggle and place it in the appropriate directory.

Usage
(This section will be updated with instructions on how to run the model for prediction once the code is available.)

Typically, usage would involve:

Loading the trained model.

Providing an input image (or a batch of images).

Running the prediction.

Interpreting the output (e.g., predicted flower class and confidence score).
